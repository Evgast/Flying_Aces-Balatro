# Flying-Aces---Balatro
A clanky little Balatro API mod that adds a new type of cards with two subsets. You can choose one at the beggining of the run! There are 6 Flying Aces available in the base mod, 3 of Tuning subset and 3 of Trinket subset.
Tunings are cards that have two use buttons for defferent functionalities, while Trinkets are much simpler, having only one button.
