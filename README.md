# Flying Aces - Balatro
A clanky little Balatro API mod that adds a new type of cards with two subsets. You can choose one at the beggining of the run! There are 6(+1) Flying Aces available in the base mod, 3(+1) of Tuning subset and 3 of Trinket subset.
Tunings are cards that have two use buttons for different functions, while Trinkets are much simpler, having only one button.
